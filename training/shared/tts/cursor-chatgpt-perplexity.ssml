        Let's talk tools. The biggest productivity killer is using the wrong AI for the job.

        Perplexity is your researcher. It browses the live web. Use it to find the latest Pega documentation, compliance laws, or industry news. It cites its sources.
        ChatGPT is your strategist. Use it to draft emails, summarize meeting notes, or brainstorm architecture. It is the best at pure reasoning.
        Cursor is your builder. It lives in your code editor. It sees your files. Use it to refactor legacy code, write unit tests, or explain complex logic.

        Let's look at real business cases.
        For Document Management, stop reading every page. Upload your PDFs to ChatGPT and ask for a synthesis. You just saved 5 hours.
        For Data Extraction, paste a messy email into ChatGPT and ask for JSON output. You just replaced manual data entry.
        For Coding, open a legacy file in Cursor and hit Command K. Type Explain this and add comments. You just documented your technical debt in seconds.
        The ROI comes from picking the right engine for the task.

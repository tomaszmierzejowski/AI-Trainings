00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to the Cursor, ChatGPT, and Perplexity power stack. Use each tool for its strength.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Perplexity is for public, cited research. Use it to ground prompts with sources.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
ChatGPT is for drafting: emails, meeting notes, rationales, and prompt experiments. Keep instructions clear and outputs structured.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Cursor is for implementation: reading rules, proposing edits, and generating focused tests. Keep diffs small and review every change.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Safety setup: fictional data only, approved endpoints, small batches, and prompt logging. Respect VPN or SSO requirements.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Pega tie-ins include explaining rules, suggesting stage or routing changes, drafting persona scripts, and creating test data.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Next steps: research with Perplexity, draft with ChatGPT, implement and review with Cursor, and log prompts and results.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Q and A. One: When should I avoid Perplexity? When data is confidential; use internal sources only. Two: How do I keep Cursor changes safe? Make small diffs, review, and avoid secrets. Three: What if ChatGPT is verbose? Add word limits and structured formats, and request a short rationale plus final answer.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome to Pega Workflow AI, the reusable pattern: intake, triage, decision, action, and feedback.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,000
At intake, an LLM classifies and extracts key fields. At triage, a prediction scores urgency or value. At decision, real-time decisioning selects the next best action with constraints.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
At action, a GenAI connector drafts the email or note. Feedback logs outcomes to improve prompts and models.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Use Process AI for predictions, Decisioning for arbitration, and GenAI connectors for bounded language tasks.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Keep outputs structured—JSON for routing and concise summaries for people. Start fast with App Studio templates, then attach Prediction or Decision strategies.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Next steps: pick one friction point, define structured outputs, connect to fictional datasets, and log prompts and results.

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Q and A. One: How do we pick where to start? Target the highest-friction KPI step. Two: Can LLMs decide routing? They can propose, but rules or decision tables should finalize. Three: How do we improve over time? Capture feedback, grow golden sets, refine prompts, and retrain predictions as data shifts.

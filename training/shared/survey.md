## Pre-Training Survey (Reusable)

Purpose: tailor agenda, demos, and labs. English-first; add Polish examples for user-facing text if it helps engagement. Do **not** share real customer data—keep answers high level and fictional where needed.

How to use:
- Send 3–5 business days before training; collect 1 response per team/function.
- Mark any items that have strict legal/security constraints.
- We will mirror answers into agendas, examples, and labs.

Questions (10–15; keep all):
1) Role + primary workflows (BA, consultant, sales engineer, system architect, developer, other) and top 2 recurring tasks.  
2) Top 2–3 KPIs/SLAs you own (cycle time, CSAT/NPS, conversion, AHT, backlog aging, compliance hits).  
3) Current tooling for workflow/case design and AI (Pega App Studio, Dev Studio, Prediction Studio, Decisioning, Excel, custom scripts).  
4) Biggest friction in building/changing workflows (requirements churn, data access, UX updates, rule governance, testing).  
5) Decision bottlenecks today (routing, prioritization, SLAs, approvals, eligibility, offers/next-best-action).  
6) Data sensitivity rules (PII classes, records/contracts that must not be used, redaction requirements).  
7) Security/legal constraints (network isolation, no external SaaS, approved LLM list, logging/audit mandates).  
8) Desired AI outcomes (faster intake, smarter triage, NBA, email/chat drafting, document extraction, UI scaffolding).  
9) Preferred demo/lab domain (claims, onboarding, sales ops, service, HR, finance) and any safe fictional data we can use.  
10) Success definition for this training (publish a prototype, ship prompt cookbook, fill automation backlog, PoC demo).  
11) Experience level with Cursor/ChatGPT/Perplexity (novice/comfortable/power) plus access constraints (VPN, SSO, browser limits).  
12) Experience with Pega AI (Prediction Studio, real-time decisioning, process AI, GenAI connectors, DX APIs).  
13) Collaboration mode (hybrid/in-room), Polish vs. English expectations, accessibility needs.  
14) Governance stakeholders (risk, security, data, legal) and approval checkpoints we must respect.  
15) Upcoming deadlines/events this training should support (release, demo, RFP, PoC) and target dates.  

Optional (helps customize labs):
- Volume/throughput targets and SLA pain points.  
- Existing prompt library, automation standards, or UI templates we should align to.

## Slide Outline Template (Copy/Paste)

Module: <name>  
Audience: <roles>  
Objective: <what they will achieve>  

For each slide use:
- Title (English) — (Polish: <optional>)  
- 3–5 bullets max (concise, action-oriented).  
- Speaker notes: 2–4 sentences with guidance, examples, and reminders on data safety.  

Suggested slide flow:
1) Why it matters (problem/KPI).  
2) Key concept or pattern.  
3) Demo/example (screens/flow).  
4) How-to steps (numbered).  
5) Risks/limits + mitigations.  
6) Checklist/next actions and owner.  

Tips:
- Keep slides terse; move depth to speaker notes and labs.  
- Add Polish alternates only for user-facing text or titles where helpful.  
- Include reminders: fictional data only, approved endpoints, logging.

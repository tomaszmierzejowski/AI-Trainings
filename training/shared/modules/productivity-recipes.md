### Audiobook Script (6–7 min + Q&A)
"Productivity comes from repeatable recipes tuned to each role. For BAs and consultants, draft user stories, acceptance criteria, and stage descriptions, plus risk logs and workshop playbacks. For sales engineers, create persona scripts, demo storylines, and crisp follow-up emails with fictional data. For system architects, use Cursor to explain rules, suggest safer versions, and add targeted tests—always in small diffs.  
Pair tools: Cursor for code and tests, ChatGPT for drafts, Perplexity for cited facts. Start with acceptance criteria, run the prompt, review critically, and log good prompts in the cookbook. Keep outputs tied to a case or decision so the work is actionable and traceable."  

Likely Q&A:
- Q: How do we keep outputs consistent across roles?  
  A: Share a prompt cookbook with accepted formats and examples; review quarterly.  
- Q: How much detail should a prompt include?  
  A: Enough context, constraints, and format to avoid ambiguity; avoid long narratives.  
- Q: Can we reuse prompts across clients?  
  A: Yes—swap domain terms and fictional data, keep structure; ensure alignment with each client’s policies.

## Tool Selection & Business Workflows

### Slides
- Slide 1 — The AI Stack (Polish: Stos technologiczny)
  - **Perplexity**: The Knowledge Engine (Research, Citations).
  - **ChatGPT**: The Reasoning Engine (Drafting, Logic, Strategy).
  - **Cursor**: The Build Engine (Code, Config, Refactoring).
  - Speaker notes: "Stop using the wrong tool. You wouldn't hammer a nail with a screwdriver."

- Slide 2 — Decision Matrix (Polish: Macierz decyzyjna)
  - Need facts/news? -> Perplexity.
  - Need text/summary? -> ChatGPT.
  - Need file edits? -> Cursor.
  - Need UI mock? -> MagicUI/Lovable (optional).
  - Speaker notes: "Memorize this matrix. It saves hours of frustration."

- Slide 3 — Business Use Case: Document Mgmt (Polish: Dokumentacja)
  - **Problem**: Scattered specs and wikis.
  - **Tool**: Notion AI or ChatGPT Projects.
  - **Action**: "Summarize these 5 PDFs into a single feature spec."
  - **ROI**: 5-10 hours/week saved.

- Slide 4 — Business Use Case: Data Extraction (Polish: Ekstrakcja danych)
  - **Problem**: Manual entry from emails/forms.
  - **Tool**: ChatGPT (with RTF prompt) or Cursor (scripting).
  - **Action**: "Extract Client, Policy#, and Claim Amount to JSON."
  - **ROI**: 90% faster than manual entry.

- Slide 5 — Business Use Case: Coding & Config (Polish: Kod i Konfiguracja)
  - **Problem**: Legacy rules, missing tests.
  - **Tool**: Cursor.
  - **Action**: "Explain this Java step. Write a JUnit test for it."
  - **ROI**: 2-4x faster development cycle.

- Slide 6 — Pega Alignment (Polish: Kontekst Pega)
  - Research Pega 8.8 syntax (Perplexity).
  - Draft User Stories (ChatGPT).
  - Implement Unit Tests (Cursor).
  - Speaker notes: "This stack accelerates the entire Pega delivery lifecycle."

### Audiobook Script (7 min + Q&A)
"Let's talk tools. The biggest productivity killer is using the wrong AI for the job.
**Perplexity** is your researcher. It browses the live web. Use it to find the latest Pega documentation, compliance laws, or industry news. It cites its sources.
**ChatGPT** is your strategist. Use it to draft emails, summarize meeting notes, or brainstorm architecture. It is the best at pure reasoning.
**Cursor** is your builder. It lives in your code editor. It sees your files. Use it to refactor legacy code, write unit tests, or explain complex logic.
Let's look at real business cases.
For **Document Management**, stop reading every page. Upload your PDFs to ChatGPT and ask for a synthesis. You just saved 5 hours.
For **Data Extraction**, paste a messy email into ChatGPT and ask for JSON output. You just replaced manual data entry.
For **Coding**, open a legacy file in Cursor and hit Command-K. Type 'Explain this and add comments'. You just documented your technical debt in seconds.
The ROI comes from picking the right engine for the task."

Likely Q&A:
- Q: Can I paste code into ChatGPT?
  A: For small snippets, yes. For whole files or project context, use Cursor—it's safer and context-aware.
- Q: Is Perplexity better than Google?
  A: For work, yes. It gives you the answer + citation, not just a list of links to click.
- Q: What about free tools?
  A: ChatGPT Free is great for text. Perplexity Free is great for search. Cursor has a free tier. You can start with zero budget.

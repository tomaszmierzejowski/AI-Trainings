## Agendas (Hybrid-Friendly)

Resources: slide decks in training/shared/slides/ and pptx in training/shared/pptx/, TTS/MP3 in training/shared/tts/ and training/shared/audio/, prompt packs in training/shared/labs/packs/, datasets in training/shared/assets/fictional-datasets/, cookbook in training/shared/prompt-cookbook.md.

Assume 09:00–17:00 with 60–90 mins total for breaks. Materials per module: slide deck, speaker notes, audiobook script, lab sheets, sample prompts, fictional datasets, and access to Cursor + ChatGPT/approved LLM + Perplexity. Optional demo path: MagicUI.ai/Lovable.

### 1-Day (Executive + Hands-on Sprint)
- 09:00–09:30 — Kickoff & Survey Readout — Objectives: align success criteria; confirm constraints. Materials: survey summary, agenda.  
- 09:30–10:30 — AI Fundamentals for Enterprise — Objective: shared vocabulary, limits. Materials: modules/ai-fundamentals.md.  
- 10:30–11:30 — Prompting Power Skills — Objective: repeatable prompts, guardrails. Materials: modules/prompting-power.md; Exercise: prompt ladder on 5 examples.  
- 11:45–12:45 — Cursor / ChatGPT / Perplexity Power Use — Objective: coding + research workflows. Materials: modules/cursor-chatgpt-perplexity.md; Exercise: explain-and-refine rule text.  
- 13:45–15:00 — Pega Workflow AI + Low-Code Boost — Objective: map AI to intake/triage/NBA. Materials: modules/pega-workflow-ai.md; Demo: case triage draft.  
- 15:00–16:00 — Governance & Safety — Objective: policies, data handling, audit. Materials: modules/governance-safety.md; Output: governance checklist.  
- 16:00–17:00 — Lab 1: Case Intake + Triage Draft — Materials: labs.md (Lab 1) and labs/packs/lab1.md; Tools: Cursor + ChatGPT; Output: prompt pack + mock flow.

### 2-Day (Practitioner Focus)
- **Day 1:** same as 1-day through 15:00, then:  
  - 15:00–17:00 — Lab 2: Real-time Decisioning Mock — Materials: labs.md (Lab 2) and labs/packs/lab2.md; Output: decision matrix + test run.  
- **Day 2:**  
  - 09:00–09:30 — Recap & Q&A.  
  - 09:30–10:45 — Productivity Recipes by Role — Materials: modules/productivity-recipes.md; Exercise: email/chat/meeting-note drafts.  
  - 11:00–12:00 — Builder Tools (MagicUI.ai/Lovable) — Objective: rapid UI/app scaffolding. Materials: modules/builder-tools.md; Demo: intake + review mock.  
  - 13:00–15:00 — Lab 3: Low-Code Case Prototype — Materials: labs.md (Lab 3) and labs/packs/lab3.md; Output: stage design + UI mock + routing notes.  
  - 15:00–16:15 — Governance Deep Dive — Build RACI, logging/audit checklist; Materials: modules/governance-safety.md.  
  - 16:15–17:00 — Readout — Outcomes, blockers, next steps; Materials: readout template (in slides).

### 3-Day (Full Enablement)
- **Day 1:** same as 1-day (core).  
- **Day 2:** same as 2-day Day 2 through Lab 3.  
- **Day 3:**  
  - 09:00–10:00 — Data & Evaluation — Objective: test plans, metrics; Materials: eval checklist (in modules/governance-safety.md).  
  - 10:15–12:00 — Role Pods Build Time — Teams build mini-solution; Coach check-ins; Materials: all module scripts + labs.  
  - 13:00–15:00 — Pod Finalization — Add governance hooks, logging, policies; Materials: governance checklist.  
  - 15:00–16:30 — Final Presentations — Criteria: objective fit, safety, clarity; Materials: presentation template.  
  - 16:30–17:00 — Action Plan — Backlog, owners, dates; Materials: action-tracker snippet in slides.

Hybrid tips:
- Allow remote pods; provide repo links and shared prompt cookbook.  
- Use fictional datasets; never real customer data.  
- English-first; add Polish examples for user-facing text when it aids clarity.

# Pega Workflow AI (Shared Pattern)
- Intake → triage → decision → action → feedback
- Fictional data only
Notes: Pattern reusable across domains.

---
# Agenda
- Workflow map
- AI touchpoints
- Process AI & Decisioning
- Low-code accelerators
- GenAI connectors
- Example flow
Notes: 45–60 minutes.

---
# Workflow Map (Mapa)
- Intake, triage, decision, action, feedback
- Find friction tied to KPI
Notes: Anchor every AI step to KPI.

---
# AI Touchpoints (Punkty)
- Classify, extract, summarize, route, recommend, draft
- Structured outputs (JSON/table)
Notes: Keep routing/eligibility deterministic where possible.

---
# Process AI & Decisioning
- Process AI: signals/predictions
- Decisioning: NBA arbitration with constraints
Notes: Prediction answers "how valuable/risky"; decisioning answers "what to do".

---
# Low-Code Accelerators
- App Studio templates, data objects, personas
- Start fast; wire AI later
Notes: Template first, intelligence second.

---
# GenAI Connectors
- Draft emails; summarize interactions
- Suggest rules; classification/extraction
Notes: Bound outputs; avoid free text for routing.

---
# Example Flow (Przykład)
- Email intake → case type + routing
- NBA offer → summary note
- Feedback logged for improvement
Notes: Show with fictional claim + service example.

---
# Wrap
- Start where friction is highest
- Keep structured outputs + logging
- Iterate with feedback and golden sets
Notes: Link to labs and prompt packs.

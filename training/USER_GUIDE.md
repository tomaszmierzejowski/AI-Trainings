# Participant User Guide

Welcome to the Practical AI Training. This guide will help you get set up and find the materials you need.

## 🏁 Start Here

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   **Browser**: Chrome or Edge.
    *   **Accounts**:
        *   **Perplexity** (Free or Pro) for research.
        *   **ChatGPT** (Plus recommended) for drafting and reasoning.
        *   **Cursor** (Free) as your code editor.
    *   **Optional**: MagicUI.ai or Lovable account for UI labs.

2.  **Files You Need**:
    *   All lab materials are in the `training/` folder.
    *   Datasets are in `training/shared/assets/fictional-datasets/`.

## 📚 Course Materials

### Slides & Audio
You can follow along with the slides and audiobook summaries:
*   **English Decks**: `training/shared/pptx/`
*   **Polish Decks**: `training/shared/pptx-pl/`
*   **Audiobooks**: `training/shared/audio-online/` (MP3s in EN and PL)

### Hands-On Labs
Labs are located in `training/shared/labs.md`.
*   **Lab 1: Intelligent Intake**: Use `service.csv` to practice email classification.
*   **Lab 2: Decision Strategy**: Use `claims.csv` to build a decision matrix.
*   **Lab 3: Rapid Prototyping**: Build a Pega Case Type spec from a UI mock.

### Prompting Cheat Sheet
Refer to `training/shared/modules/prompting-power.md` for the **RTF Framework** (Role-Task-Format) and other techniques.

## 🛡️ Safety First
*   **No Real Data**: Never use real customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Use the provided fictional datasets.
*   **Approved Tools Only**: Do not paste internal code into unapproved public tools.
*   **Verify Everything**: AI hallucinates. Check citations (Perplexity) and review code (Cursor).

## 🚀 Troubleshooting
*   **"My prompt isn't working"**: Check the RTF formula. Did you specify a **Role**? Did you give a **Constraint**?
*   **"I can't access the tool"**: Pair up with a colleague or use the "Sandbox" account provided by your trainer.

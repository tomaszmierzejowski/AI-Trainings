## Adaptation Notes (Pega Poland)

Use these when cloning for a specific client from the Krakow hub.

- Language: instruction in English; add Polish for user-facing text only.  
- Domains: start with claims/onboarding/service; swap domain with fictional data from `assets/fictional-datasets.md`.  
- Tooling: confirm approved LLM endpoints; remove tools not allowed (e.g., external SaaS) and offer offline alternatives.  
- Governance: emphasize PII masking, audit logs, access groups, masked data pages, approved connector list, and retention rules.  
- Labs: keep the three labs but replace channels/queues and data to match client; maintain success criteria.  
- Artifacts: log prompts/responses; store mapping notes from UI mocks to App Studio; keep demo assets scrubbed.

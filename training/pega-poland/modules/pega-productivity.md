### Audiobook Script (5–6 min + Q&A)
"For the Krakow hub, here are fast, repeatable recipes. BAs and consultants draft stage descriptions, user stories, acceptance criteria, and risk logs—then localize user-facing text to Polish when needed. Sales engineers build persona scripts, demo storylines, objection handling notes, and crisp follow-up emails that showcase cases, decisioning, and GenAI summaries. System architects use Cursor to explain rules, propose safer refactors, and add small, targeted tests.  
Tool pairing: Cursor for code and tests, ChatGPT for drafts, Perplexity for cited facts. Start with acceptance criteria, run the prompt, review, and log successful patterns in the prompt cookbook. Everything uses fictional data and respects approved endpoints."  

Likely Q&A:
- Q: How do we keep bilingual outputs consistent?  
  A: Keep specs/logic in English; add Polish for user-facing text; note language in the prompt.  
- Q: How to avoid over-sharing in demos?  
  A: Use fictional datasets, remove PII, and keep examples minimal; log prompts.  
- Q: Where do we store good prompts?  
  A: In a shared prompt cookbook in the repo; tag by role/use case and review quarterly.

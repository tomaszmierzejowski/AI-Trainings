## Tool Selection & Setup (Decision Tree)

### Slide Outline
- **The Stack**: Perplexity (Know) → ChatGPT (Draft) → Cursor (Build).
- **Decision Tree**:
  - Need facts/citations? -> Perplexity.
  - Need text/creative/logic? -> ChatGPT.
  - Need code/diffs/files? -> Cursor.
- **Setup**: Config for privacy (Turn off training where possible).

### Speaker Notes
- **Perplexity**: "It's your research assistant that cites sources. Use it to find Pega documentation or public compliance rules."
- **ChatGPT**: "The engine for drafting emails, user stories, and logic. Great for 'reasoning' tasks."
- **Cursor**: "Your IDE on steroids. It sees your codebase. Use it to refactor rules, write tests, or explain legacy code."
- **MagicUI/Lovable**: "Specialists for rapid UI prototyping. Use sparingly for demos, not production code."

### Audiobook Script (5 min)
"Stop guessing which tool to use. Here is the decision tree.
If you need facts, citations, or recent news—like 'What are the latest GDPR fines?'—use Perplexity. It searches the web and cites sources.
If you need to draft content, summarize notes, or brainstorm logic—use ChatGPT. It's your reasoning engine.
If you are touching code, files, or configuration—use Cursor. It understands your project context and can apply diffs directly.
Don't paste code into ChatGPT if you can use Cursor. Don't ask Cursor for recent news. Use the right tool for the job to move fast and stay safe."

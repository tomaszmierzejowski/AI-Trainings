Use only fictional data for demos/labs.

Suggested quick datasets:
- Claims: policy_id, claim_type, amount, severity, channel, language.  
- Onboarding: applicant_id, product, KYC_flag, risk_score, region.  
- Service: ticket_id, sentiment, issue_type, SLA_hours, customer_tier.  

Keep small CSVs (10–30 rows) and redact anything that could be real.

## Pre-Training Survey (Pega Poland)

Purpose: tailor agendas, demos, labs for Krakow hub. English-first; add Polish examples for user-facing text. No real customer data.

How to use:
- Send 3–5 business days before delivery; 1 response per team/function.
- Mark any strict legal/security constraints; include approved LLM endpoints.

Questions (keep all):
1) Role/team and primary workflows in Pega (App Studio, Dev Studio, Prediction Studio, Decisioning, client delivery, presales).  
2) Current KPIs/SLAs (case cycle time, backlog aging, offer acceptance, CSAT/NPS, AHT).  
3) Pega AI features in use/planned (Process AI, real-time decisioning, NBA, GenAI connectors, email bots).  
4) Pain points in building/changing workflows (requirements churn, governance, data access, UX, approvals).  
5) Decision bottlenecks (routing, prioritization, eligibility, NBA, exception handling).  
6) Data sensitivity rules (PII classes, masking, on-prem vs. cloud, approved LLM endpoints).  
7) Security/legal constraints (VPN/SSO, no external SaaS, audit/logging needs, export controls).  
8) Desired outcomes (case prototype, prompt library, demo for prospect, internal accelerator).  
9) Preferred demo domain + safe fictional data (claims, onboarding, service, sales ops).  
10) Tool access (Cursor, ChatGPT tier, Perplexity, MagicUI.ai/Lovable) and network limits.  
11) Language split expectations (Polish vs English) for labs/artifacts; accessibility needs.  
12) Governance stakeholders (risk, security, data, legal) and approval checkpoints.  
13) Upcoming deadlines (release, RFP, PoC, demo) with dates.  
14) Collaboration mode (hybrid/on-site) and meeting tools allowed.  
15) Existing accelerators to align to (prompt standards, UI templates, Pega patterns).  

Optional: Throughput targets, SLA pain areas, reusable scrubbed sample data sources.

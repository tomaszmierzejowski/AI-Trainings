## Agendas (Practical AI Training)

Focus: 80% hands-on, 20% theory. Outcome-driven (reduce cycle time, improve quality).
Resources: slide decks in `training/shared/slides/`, TTS in `training/shared/tts/`, prompt packs in `training/shared/labs/packs/`, datasets in `training/shared/assets/fictional-datasets/`.
